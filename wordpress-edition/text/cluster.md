## Cluster 
The Cluster package is a clustered solution for maximum availability and scalability. The architecture is based on double instances for the satellite nodes such as routing, storage, and caching and includes pre-configured horizontal scaling triggers to provide auto-scalability on the core nodes such as compute and database. The software stack is pre-configured and powered by the LiteSpeed Web ADC for load-balancing and centralized cache management, the LiteSpeed Web Server with LSPHP handler engine, and the LiteSpeed WordPress plugin with ESI support and Object caching.
